# Grocery Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a grocery dataset using the R programming language. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, clustering, and pattern detection, all presented through a Shiny-based graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset to ensure quality and accuracy.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilized pie charts, scatter plots, bar plots, and box plots to visualize the data.
- **Clustering:** Applied k-means clustering to group the data into meaningful clusters.
- **Association Rules:** Implemented association rules to identify patterns and relationships in the dataset based on minimum support and confidence.
- **Interactive GUI:** Integrated all functionalities into a Shiny-based GUI with input validation.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** R
- **GUI Framework:** Shiny
- **Data Visualization:** different plots
- **Clustering:** k-means
- **Association Rules:** arules package

## Time Frame
- we started this project on the 2nd of May 2024 and I managed to finish the project on the 11th of May 2024.

  ## Team
